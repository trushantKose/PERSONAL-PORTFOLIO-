# DESCRIPTION #

This portfolio website is a fully responsive, modern, and visually appealing personal portfolio designed to showcase my skills, experience, services, and projects as a web developer. Built using core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—this project represents both my frontend design capabilities and real-world project structuring.

* Key Features
Hero Section: A welcoming landing area with my name, profession, and a short introduction.

Responsive Navigation Menu: Mobile-friendly burger menu and side navigation with JavaScript-based toggle for open/close behavior.

About Me Section: Highlights my background, passion for web development, and strengths in both frontend and backend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.

Tabbed Content UI: The “About” section uses a clean tabbed interface (Skills, Experience, Education) built with JavaScript to toggle views dynamically.

Services Section: Clearly presents the web development services I offer—Web Design, UI/UX Design, and Full Stack Development—with icons and short descriptions.

Project Portfolio: A gallery of real-world projects I have built. Each project has an image preview, overlay description, and an external link icon for visiting or learning more.

Contact Form: Functional contact form that submits messages directly to Google Sheets using a Google Apps Script endpoint.

Download CV Button: Visitors can download my resume with a single click.

Social Media Integration: Links to my Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Telegram accounts are included with respective icons.

JavaScript Interactions: Tabs, menu toggle, and contact form interactions are powered using lightweight, clean JavaScript.

Mobile Friendly & Responsive Design: Built using modern CSS best practices, the website is responsive on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
